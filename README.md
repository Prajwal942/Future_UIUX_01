## 🍽️ Restaurant Menu & Ordering Interface – UI/UX Design

### 🔹 Task Overview  
This task involved designing a complete digital restaurant menu and ordering interface that allows users to browse food items by category, view dish images, customize their order, and place requests seamlessly for both dine-in and takeaway.

### 🔹 What I Designed  
For this project, I created a full end-to-end design package, including:

- 📘 **Style Guide** (colors, typography, UI rules)
- 🧩 **Component Library** (buttons, cards, nav bars, input fields)
- 📝 **Wireframes** (low-fidelity layouts of all major screens)
- 🎨 **High-Fidelity Screens** (final visual design)
- 📄 **Case Study** (complete breakdown of the design process)

This helped create a smooth, restaurant-friendly digital experience with clear navigation and easy ordering.
